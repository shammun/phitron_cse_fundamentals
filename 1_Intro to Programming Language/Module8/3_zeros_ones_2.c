/*

In this problem you will be given an integer N, followed by an array containing N numbers.

Each numbers will be either 0 or 1.

You will also be an integer X.

You will have to toggle the X_th value in the array. Toggle means if the value is 0, you will make it 1 and if it is 1 you have to make it 0.

Then you have to print the array.

Input Format

The first line will contain a single integer N.
The second line will contain N integers.
The third line will contain a single integer X.
Constraints

1 <= N, X <= 100000
Each N numbers will be either 0 or 1.
Output Format

Print the array after updating.
